Overview
========

``configflow`` - is the configuration management library for Python. It easily allows you to:

- Load your configuration from files, environment variables, command-line arguments and more sources.
- Transform the loaded data into the desired format and validate it via `pydantic <https://github.com/samuelcolvin/pydantic>`_.
- Access the results as `Python dataclass-like objects <https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html>`_.
- Make your codebase very flexible.
